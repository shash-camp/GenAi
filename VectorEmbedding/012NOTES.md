# Types of Vector Embeddings by Data Type

Here‚Äôs a **simple and short explanation** for different types of vector embeddings based on the type of input data.

---

## 1. Word Embeddings

- Word embeddings turn words into number vectors.
- Models like **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **fastText** are used.
- They place similar words (like "king" and "queen") close together in vector space.
- **fastText** also works well with new or rare words using sub-word parts.

---

## 2. Sentence and Document Embeddings

- These turn full sentences or documents into vectors.
- **Doc2Vec** creates document-level vectors.
- **BERT** creates context-aware sentence embeddings.
- Useful for tasks like text similarity and classification.

---

## 3. Image Embeddings

- CNN models like **ResNet** or **Inception** extract features from images.
- They turn images into vectors showing visual details (like shapes or objects).
- These embeddings help in image search, recognition, and classification.

---

## 4. Time Series Embeddings

- LSTM and GRU models are used to embed time series data.
- They learn patterns over time (like in stock price movements).
- These embeddings help in forecasting and time-based pattern detection.

---

## 5. Audio Embeddings

- Audio data is turned into vectors using techniques like **MFCC**.
- They capture sound features like tone or frequency.
- Useful in speech recognition or sound classification.

---

## 6. Graph Embeddings

- These represent nodes and connections in a graph.
- **Node2Vec** creates embeddings where connected or similar nodes are close together.
- **GNNs (Graph Neural Networks)** can also learn complex graph structures.
- Used in social networks and recommendation systems.

# üìå Applications of Vector Embeddings (Simplified)

Vector embeddings convert complex data (text, images, audio, molecules, etc.) into fixed-size numeric vectors.  
This allows machines to perform **similarity search, pattern recognition, and predictions** more efficiently.

## 1. üñºÔ∏è Image, Video, and Audio Similarity Search

- **What Happens:** Media files (image/audio/video) are passed through deep models like CNNs or audio feature extractors.
- **Use Case:** When a user searches with an image/audio/video, its embedding is compared to stored embeddings to find similar content.
- **Example:**  
  - Google Lens (image search)  
  - YouTube thumbnail matching  
  - Shazam (audio/music matching)

---

## 2. üíä AI in Drug Discovery

- **What Happens:** Molecules or chemical compounds are transformed into embeddings based on their structure.
- **Use Case:** Similar embeddings imply similar behavior ‚Äî useful for finding new drugs or treatments.
- **Example:**  
  - Predict potential drug candidates based on molecular similarity  
  - Discover similar compounds with known effects

---

## 3. üîé Semantic Search Engine

- **What Happens:** Both queries and documents are turned into vector embeddings.
- **Use Case:** Matches are made based on **semantic meaning**, not just keywords.
- **Example:**  
  - A query like ‚Äúheart attack treatment‚Äù matches documents mentioning ‚Äúcardiac arrest therapies‚Äù (even if the exact words differ)

---

## 4. üéØ Recommender Systems

- **What Happens:** Users and items (movies, products, songs) are embedded in the same vector space.
- **Use Case:** Recommendations are based on **closeness of vectors** between user preferences and item features.
- **Example:**  
  - Netflix, Spotify, or Amazon recommending content based on your viewing/listening/shopping habits.

---

## 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Anomaly Detection

- **What Happens:** All data is embedded into a high-dimensional space.
- **Use Case:** If a data point is **far from the rest**, it is likely to be an anomaly.
- **Example:**  
  - Credit card fraud detection  
  - Network intrusion alerts  
  - Sensor failure detection
