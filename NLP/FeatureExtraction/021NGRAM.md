# 🔷 What is an N-gram?

An **N-gram** is a **sequence of N words** taken from a given sentence or document.  
It helps preserve **word order** and **context** (which Bag of Words ignores).

## 🔹 Why N-grams?

Bag of Words treats `"not good"` and `"very good"` almost the same (just by word count).  
But these two have **very different meanings** in real life.  
N-grams solve this by **looking at sequences** of words instead of single words.

## 🔹 Types of N-grams

| Type                 | Description               | Example from sentence: `"I love playing cricket"` |
|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Unigram (1-gram)** | Single words              | `["I", "love", "playing", "cricket"]`             |
| **Bigram (2-gram)**  | 2-word combinations       | `["I love", "love playing", "playing cricket"]`   |
| **Trigram (3-gram)** | 3-word combinations       | `["I love playing", "love playing cricket"]`      |
| **n-gram**           | Any `n` word combinations | `["I love playing cricket"]` for 4-gram           |

## 🔹 Example: Compare with Bag of Words

**Sentence:** `"I don't like this movie"`

### Bag of Words:
Just counts words:
- `"I"`: 1  
- `"don't"`: 1  
- `"like"`: 1  
- `"this"`: 1  
- `"movie"`: 1  

It won’t capture that `"don't like"` expresses **negative sentiment**.

### Bigrams:
- `["I don't", "don't like", "like this", "this movie"]`  
Now, `"don't like"` becomes a single feature — better context.

# ✅ Advantages of N-grams

| Advantage                | Description                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✔ Captures Local Context | Preserves **word order** and nearby word relationships.                                                     |
| ✔ Handles Phrases        | Recognizes expressions like `"not good"` or `"very nice"` which have **meaning as a whole**.                |
| ✔ Improves Text Models   | Better than BoW in tasks like **sentiment analysis**, **text classification**, and **machine translation**. |

# ❌ Disadvantages of N-grams

| Disadvantage                 | Description                                                                          |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ High Dimensionality        | Bigger `n` means **more unique phrases**, which increases feature space.             |
| ❌ Sparse Data                | Most combinations don’t appear often → leads to **lots of zero values**.             |
| ❌ Memory and Speed           | Large n-grams slow down training and increase memory usage.                          |
| ❌ Doesn’t Understand Meaning | Still no **semantic understanding** (e.g., "film" and "movie" treated as unrelated). |

# 💡 Use Cases of N-grams

| Use Case                      | Description                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔍 **Search Engines**         | Improve results with phrase-based matches. `"new york"` ≠ `"new car"`         |
| 📊 **Sentiment Analysis**     | Understand phrases like `"not good"` (negative) or `"very happy"` (positive). |
| 🤖 **Chatbots & Translation** | Predict next word or translate based on recent phrases.                       |
| 📝 **Spelling Correction**    | Detect likely word pairs: `"I am going too the market"` → `"to the market"`   |
