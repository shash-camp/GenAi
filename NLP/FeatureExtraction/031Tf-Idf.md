# 💡 What is TF-IDF?

TF-IDF is a **feature extraction technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP)** used to convert **text data into numerical form**, which can be fed into a machine learning model.

It stands for:

- **TF (Term Frequency):** How often a word appears in a document.
- **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency):** How unique or rare a word is across all documents.

> 👉 **Goal:** Give high importance to words that are frequent in a particular document but rare across the entire dataset.

## 📘 Why Not Just Use Word Counts (Bag of Words)?

In **Bag of Words**, words like “the,” “is,” or “and” may appear frequently — but they don’t carry useful meaning. Still, they are given high importance due to high count.

To solve this problem, we use **TF-IDF**, which downplays common words and highlights rare but meaningful words.

## 🧮 TF-IDF Formula

### 1. **Term Frequency (TF)**

How frequently a term occurs in a document:


**Example:**

In document D1: `"NLP is fun and learning NLP is easy"`  
Word `"NLP"` appears **2 times**, total words = 8


---

### 2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**

How rare the word is in the **entire corpus** (all documents):

IDF(t) = log(Total number of documents / Number of documents containing term t)


If a word appears in **all documents**, it’s not important → low IDF.  
If a word appears in **few documents**, it’s rare → high IDF.

---

### 3. **TF-IDF Score**

TF-IDF(t) = TF(t) × IDF(t)


✅ High TF-IDF = important to a specific document  
❌ Low TF-IDF = common or not meaningful

---

## 🔍 Example

### Suppose 3 documents:

- D1: "AI is the future"
- D2: "AI and ML are the future"
- D3: "The future is bright with AI"

Let’s compute TF-IDF for `"AI"`:

- **TF("AI", D1)** = 1/4 = 0.25  
- **DF("AI")** = Appears in all 3 docs → DF = 3  
- **IDF("AI")** = log(3/3) = 0  
- **TF-IDF = 0.25 × 0 = 0**

Even though `"AI"` appears frequently, its TF-IDF is **0** because it appears in **all docs**, so it's not special.

## ✅ Advantages of TF-IDF

- Simple to compute.
- Highlights **important terms** in a document.
- Reduces weight for common, less informative words.
- Useful in **text classification, search engines**, etc.

## ❌ Disadvantages of TF-IDF

| Problem                                                    | Better Option                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| No context or meaning                                      | Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)      |
| Doesn’t understand synonyms (“car” ≠ “automobile”)         | Word embeddings                        |
| Sparse and high-dimensional output                         | Embeddings are compact and dense       |
| Sensitive to vocabulary change                             | Embeddings are more stable             |
| Only works on words (not phrases or characters)            | Combine with n-grams or other models   |

|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TF        | Frequency of word in a document                                       |
| IDF       | Rarity of word across all documents                                   |
| TF-IDF    | Highlights unique words per document                                  |
| Purpose   | Converts text to numbers, while reducing common/noisy word impact     |
