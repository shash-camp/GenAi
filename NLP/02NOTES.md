# 🧠 Types of NLP Approaches –

---

## 1. **Rules-Based NLP (Old Method)**

- This was the **first way** computers tried to understand language.
- It worked using **if-then rules** — for example:  
  *“If the user says X, reply with Y.”*
- Everything had to be **manually programmed** ahead of time.

### 🧾 Example:
- An old phone system (like **Moviefone**) could understand only a few phrases and give basic replies.

### ⚠️ Limitations:
- It **couldn’t learn new things**
- It only worked for **very specific inputs**
- It **doesn’t scale** well for complex conversations

## 2. **Statistical NLP (Smarter Method)**

- This method came **later** and is **much smarter**
- It uses **machine learning** to:
  - Understand text and speech
  - Figure out the role of each word (like verb, noun, etc.)
  - Guess the **most likely meaning** of a word or sentence

- It turns language into **numbers and vectors** (converting words into a math form)

- This lets computers **analyze language using statistics**, like:
  - **Regression**
  - **Markov models**

### 🧾 Examples:
- Early **spellcheckers**
- **T9 texting** (used on old mobile phones for typing with number pads)

# 🧠 Deep Learning in NLP – In Simple Words

Today, **deep learning** is the most powerful method used in NLP.  
It learns from **huge amounts of text and voice data** (like books, websites, or audio files) to become smarter and more accurate.

Deep learning is an advanced version of statistical NLP, but it uses **neural networks** (like how our brain works).

There are a few important types of deep learning models:

---

## 1. 🔁 Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Models

- These models are good at **translating** one language into another.
- They use **RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks)**.
- 🧾 **Example:** Changing a sentence from German into English.

---

## 2. 🔄 Transformer Models

- Transformers are the **backbone of modern NLP**.
- They break sentences into small parts (called **tokens**) and understand the **position and meaning** of each word.
- Use **self-attention** to understand how words relate to each other.
- Trained on **huge datasets** without needing human labeling (**self-supervised**).
- 🧾 **Example:** **BERT** (used in Google Search) is a popular transformer model.

## 3. ✍️ Autoregressive Models

- A special type of transformer model.
- Trained to **predict the next word** in a sentence.
- This helps them **generate realistic text**.
- 🧾 **Examples:** **GPT (like ChatGPT), Llama, Claude, Mistral**

---

## 4. 🏗️ Foundation Models

- These are **pretrained big models** created by companies.
- You can use them directly instead of training from scratch.
- They work for many NLP tasks like:
  - **Generating content**
  - **Finding key information**
  - **Improving answers using external knowledge** (called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** or **RAG**)
- 🧾 **Example:** **IBM Granite models** used in industries.
