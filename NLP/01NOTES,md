# 🧠 Approaches to NLP (Natural Language Processing) 

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a subfield of **computer science** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** that uses **machine learning** to help computers understand and interact with human language.

## ✅ Benefits of NLP

NLP helps humans talk to computers more easily, using everyday language. This is useful in many areas:

- **Automation of repetitive tasks**
- **Improved data analysis and insights**
- **Enhanced search**
- **Content generation**

## 🔍 How NLP Works – Step by Step

NLP uses a mix of **computer science**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning** to understand human language.

At the heart of NLP is **computational linguistics** – using data and logic to study how we speak and write.

### ✨ Two Main Steps in NLP:

1. **Syntactical analysis** – Checks the **grammar** of a sentence. It figures out:
   - Where the **nouns**, **verbs**, etc. are
   - How the sentence is built

2. **Semantical analysis** – Tries to understand the **meaning** of the sentence by looking at how the words connect to form useful information.

## 🔧 Techniques Used in NLP

To break down and understand sentences, NLP often uses:

- **Dependency parsing**  
  → Looks at how words are connected (e.g., subject, verb, object)

- **Constituency parsing**  
  → Builds a **tree diagram** (parse tree) to show the full structure of the sentence

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

These NLP techniques are used in applications like:

- **Language translation** (e.g., Google Translate)
- **Speech recognition** (e.g., Siri, Alexa)

The goal is simple:  
To help **computers and humans** understand each other better using **natural language**.
