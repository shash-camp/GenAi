### 📌 What is **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)**?

An **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** is a type of machine learning model inspired by the **human brain**. It is a core part of **Deep Learning**, and many **Generative AI (GenAI)** models are built using deep ANNs (called **Deep Neural Networks**, DNNs).

### 🧠 How ANN Works – Step by Step:

An ANN is made of layers of **neurons** (also called **nodes**):

```
Input Layer → Hidden Layer(s) → Output Layer
```

#### ⚙️ 1. **Input Layer**

* Takes input features (e.g., image pixels, word embeddings).
* Each neuron represents a single feature.

#### ⚙️ 2. **Hidden Layers**

* Perform computation using **weights**, **biases**, and **activation functions**.
* Each neuron in a hidden layer:

  * Receives inputs from the previous layer.
  * Applies a **weighted sum + bias**.
  * Passes result through an **activation function** (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).

#### ⚙️ 3. **Output Layer**

* Produces final prediction or generated data.
* For GenAI: the output might be a **token**, **image pixel**, or **audio sample**.

### 🧠 ANN in Generative AI:

Generative AI models (like **GANs**, **VAEs**, or **Transformers**) rely heavily on neural networks.

#### ✅ Examples:

1. **Text Generation (GPT)**:

   * Uses deep neural networks (Transformer architecture, built using layers like ANN).
   * Learns to predict the next word/token.

2. **Image Generation (GANs)**:

   * Generator: ANN that creates new images from noise.
   * Discriminator: ANN that tries to detect fake vs real images.

3. **Music or Voice Generation**:

   * Input could be seed notes/audio.
   * ANN-based model predicts next audio sample or note.

### 🔄 Learning in ANN (Backpropagation)

1. **Forward Pass**:

   * Inputs go layer by layer and generate output.

2. **Loss Calculation**:

   * Compare predicted output with actual label/data.

3. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)**:

   * Calculate gradient of error w\.r.t. each weight.
   * Update weights using **gradient descent**.

| Component     | Purpose                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Input Layer   | Accepts features (text, image, etc.)       |
| Hidden Layers | Learn patterns through weights/activations |
| Output Layer  | Gives predictions/generations              |
| Used In GenAI | GPT, GAN, VAE, Diffusion, etc.             |
