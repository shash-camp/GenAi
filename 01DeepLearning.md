A **Deep Learning model** is a **neural network** with multiple layers that learns complex patterns from data. It is a **subset of machine learning** and mimics the way the **human brain processes information**, especially for tasks like image recognition, language translation, speech, and more.

## ‚úÖ Definition:

> **Deep Learning Model** is a type of **artificial neural network** with multiple layers (also called ‚Äúdeep‚Äù networks) that automatically learns to extract features and patterns from large volumes of data.

---

## üß† Why "Deep"?

Because the model contains **many layers** between input and output:

* **Input Layer**: Receives raw data (e.g., image pixels, text).
* **Hidden Layers**: Multiple layers where feature extraction and transformation happen.
* **Output Layer**: Produces prediction (e.g., class label, generated text).

## üß© Example:

Suppose you want to classify whether an image is of a **cat or dog**:

```
Image ‚Üí Input Layer ‚Üí Hidden Layers ‚Üí Output Layer (Cat/Dog)
```

Each layer **automatically learns features**, like:

1. Edges ‚Üí 2. Shapes ‚Üí 3. Fur patterns ‚Üí 4. Full object

| **Activation Functions** | Introduce non-linearity (`ReLU`, `Sigmoid`, `Tanh`)                        |
| **Loss Function**        | Measures prediction error (`MSE`, `CrossEntropy`)                          |
| **Optimizer**            | Minimizes loss by updating weights (e.g., `SGD`, `Adam`)                   |
| **Backpropagation**      | Learning algorithm to update weights using gradient descent                |
