**LLM** stands for **Large Language Model**.

It refers to a type of **artificial intelligence model** that is trained on a **massive amount of text data** and designed to understand, generate, and manipulate **natural language**.

### üîç Key Features of LLMs:

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large-scale**             | Trained on billions of words from books, websites, articles, etc.                           |
| **Transformer-based**       | Most modern LLMs (like GPT, BERT) use the **Transformer architecture**.                     |
| **General-purpose**         | Can do many tasks: text generation, translation, summarization, code generation, Q\&A, etc. |
| **Pretrained + Fine-tuned** | First trained on general data, then fine-tuned on specific tasks (optional).                |

### üß† Examples of LLMs:

* **GPT-4**, **GPT-3.5** (OpenAI)
* **Gemini** (Google)
* **Claude** (Anthropic)
* **LLaMA** (Meta)
* **BERT**, **RoBERTa** (Google, Facebook)

### üß© How LLMs Work (High Level):

1. **Training**:

   * Model learns patterns from large datasets using neural networks (especially Transformers).
   * It adjusts its weights through **backpropagation**.

2. **Tokenization**:

   * Text is broken into smaller pieces called **tokens** (words or subwords).

3. **Prediction**:

   * Given a sequence of tokens, it predicts the next most likely token.
   * Over time, it learns grammar, facts, reasoning, and more.

### üìö Applications:

* Chatbots (like ChatGPT)
* Code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
* Summarization tools
* Email drafting
* Language translation
* Medical diagnosis support
* Legal document analysis
